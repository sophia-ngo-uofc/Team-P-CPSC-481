# Stage One

> ## Project Progress
> For stage one of the team project, many discussions were held to prepare ourselves before we move on to the next stage and begin working on the actual project. <br/>
> We began by discussing our individual expectations and goals so that we could put together a collective set of guidelines and expectations in the form of a team contract that we could all agree on. <br/>
> Once we had our team contract put together, our discussions moved on to the topic of project ideas. We put our heads together during brainstorming sessions and came up with three ideas for our project. 
>
> ## Deliverables
> 1. <b>Team Contract:</b> As mentioned previously, after much discussion, we put together a team contract. Our team contract can be found [here](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481/blob/master/Team%20P%20Contract.pdf).<br/>  
> 2. <b>Online Repository:</b> Our team has chosen to use GitHub to host our online repository. You can view our online repository [here](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481).<br/>
> 3. <b>Project Portfolio:</b> This webpage is our project portfolio. As you can see, we have written about our project progress and deliverables at the end of each stage.<br/>
> 4. <b>Three Project Ideas:</b> Our project ideas have been described in [this](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481/blob/stage-one/Project%20Ideas.pdf) file.<br/>

# Stage Two
  
> ## Project Progress
> For stage two of the team project, we decided which project idea we wanted to move forward with: a virtual closet mobile application! We have worked together in this stage to further flesh out the details of this idea.<br/>
> After finalizing our project idea, we put our heads together to identify the stakeholders and users of our application.<br/>
> Next, with our identified potential users/stakeholders in mind, we chose three IDEO method cards to apply in our user research.<br/>
> Finally, after having completed our user research, we put together a list of user tasks. 

> ## Deliverables
> 1. <b>User Research Report:</b> To present our work at this stage, we put together a user research report. Our user research report can be found [here](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481/blob/stage-two/Stage%20Two_%20User%20Research%20Report.pdf).<br/>
