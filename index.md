# Stage One<a name="stageone"></a>

> ## Project Progress
> For stage one of the team project, many discussions were held to prepare ourselves before we move on to the next stage and begin working on the actual project. <br/>
> We began by discussing our individual expectations and goals so that we could put together a collective set of guidelines and expectations in the form of a team contract that we could all agree on. <br/>
> Once we had our team contract put together, our discussions moved on to the topic of project ideas. We put our heads together during brainstorming sessions and came up with three ideas for our project. 
>
> ## Deliverables
> 1. <b>Team Contract:</b> As mentioned previously, after much discussion, we put together a team contract. Our team contract can be found [here](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481/blob/master/Team%20P%20Contract.pdf).<br/>  
> 2. <b>Online Repository:</b> Our team has chosen to use GitHub to host our online repository. You can view our online repository [here](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481).<br/>
> 3. <b>Project Portfolio:</b> This webpage is our project portfolio. As you can see, we have written about our project progress and deliverables at the end of each stage.<br/>
> 4. <b>Three Project Ideas:</b> Our project ideas have been described in [this](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481/blob/stage-one/Project%20Ideas.pdf) file.<br/>
  
# Stage Two<a name="stagetwo"></a>
  
> ## Project Progress
> For stage two of the team project, we decided which project idea we wanted to move forward with: a virtual closet mobile application! We have worked together in this stage to further flesh out the details of this idea.<br/>
> After finalizing our project idea, we put our heads together to identify the stakeholders and users of our application.<br/>
> Next, with our identified potential users/stakeholders in mind, we chose three IDEO method cards to apply in our user research.<br/>
> Finally, after having completed our user research, we put together a list of user tasks. 

> ## Deliverables
> 1. <b>User Research Report:</b> To present our work at this stage, we put together a user research report. Our user research report can be found [here](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481/blob/stage-two/Stage%20Two_%20User%20Research%20Report.pdf).<br/>  
  
# Stage Three<a name="stagethree"></a>

> ## Project Progress
> In this stage, our efforts were focused on ideation and prototyping.<br/>
> We began by brainstorming designs for the system. Once we had come up with a variety of sketches, we discussed the ideas behind them and constructed an affinity diagram. Following the affinity diagramming session, we selected and polished a few of our most promising ideas. We then chose one of these ideas and constructed a storyboard that illustrates the scope of the interaction between the user and the interface.<br/>
> From here, we moved on to the prototyping phase. Based on the storyboard, we used Balsamiq to construct a low fidelity prototype of how we expect our system to be used. Then, we conducted a task-centered system cognitive walkthrough to evaluate the major tasks that we had identified previously in Stage Two. Based on the evaluation results, we revised our prototype.

> ## Deliverables
> 1. <b>Stage Three Report:</b> To present our progress in this stage, we have put together a report. This report can be found [here](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481/blob/stage-three/Stage%20Three%20Report.pdf).<br/>
> 2. <b>Demo Video:</b> In order to demonstrate our low-fi protoype, we've put together a video. The demo video can be found [here](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481/blob/stage-three/PrototypeDemoVid.mp4).<br/>
> 3. <b>Low-fi Prototype:</b> To check out the protoype for yourself, we have posted a soft copy of it [here](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481/blob/stage-three/Closet%20App%20Prototype.pdf).<br/>
> 4. <b>Presentation:</b> We have also put together a PowerPoint presentation of our project idea and our journey in this stage. This presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481/blob/stage-three/Stage%20Three%20Presentation.pptx).<br/>
