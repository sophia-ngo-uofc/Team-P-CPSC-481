## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Stage One Project Progress
> For stage one of the team project, many discussions were held to prepare ourselves before we move on to the next stage and begin working on the actual project. <br/>
> We began by discussing our individual expectations and goals so that we could put together a collective set of guidelines and expectations in the form of a team contract that we could all agree on. </br>
> Once we had our team contract put together, our discussions moved on to the topic of project ideas. We put our heads together during brainstorming sessions and came up with three ideas for our project. 

## Stage One Deliverables
1. <b>Team Contract:</b> As mentioned previously, after much discussion, we put together a team contract. Our team contract can be found [here](https://github.com/sophiango-uofc/Team-P-CPSC-481/blob/master/Team%20P%20Contract.pdf).<br/>  
2. <b>Online Repository:</b> Our team has chosen to use GitHub to host our online repository. If you are reading this, congratulations, you have found our online repository :)<br/>
